Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year.
A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. 
The reason why we have leap years is really fascinating, this video does it more justice:
'''
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡

if year % 4 < 1:
    if year % 100 < 1:
        if year % 400 < 1: 
            print("leap year")
        else:
            print("Not leap year")
    else:
        print("leap year")
else:
    print("Not leap year")
