Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days,
weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.
It will take your current age as the input and output a message 
with our time left in this format:
You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.
Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
